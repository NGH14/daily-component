# Sticky Sidebar

>A sticky sidebar starts in a fixed position, but when the user scrolls down and the bottom of the sidebar enters the visible area of the screen (the viewport), it "sticks" to that point, becoming stationary and staying visible as the user continues to scroll.

The key of this section is `position: sticky` with the semantic `aside` HTML tags.
