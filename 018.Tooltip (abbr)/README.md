# Tooltip by Abbr Tag

>The `<abbr>` HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym. And the `<dfn>` HTML element indicates a term to be defined. The `<dfn>` element should be used in a complete definition statement.

The key of this component is the `<dfn>` element has a title attribute, the value of the title attribute is considered to be the term being defined.

__NOTE:__ The element must still have text within it, but that text may be an abbreviation (perhaps using `<abbr>`) or another form of the term.
